HERE if N=2 THEN Second Highest salary will be Displayed

First Select Column by SELECT salary
Now SELECT DISTINCT salary because we don't want repeating value.
Arrange Salary in descending Order So we have Higest salary at TOP
Now we Only one row as output SO LIMIT 1
Now OFFSET it display N+1 row Example. if n=2 then it will show Third Highest Salary Therefore N=N-1 is used.

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN

SET N=N-1;

  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC 
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET N      
  );
END
